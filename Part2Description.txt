The APEX Mobile Application gives an overview of NBA teams from different conferences, and information about some players from each team. The application features two reports, NBA Team and NBA Player. The NBA Team report shows the user how many teams are there in the league and the conference each team competes in. The NBA Player report shows the user some of the NBA players from each team and their information such as position and height. Besides that, the application also supports a query page where the user can manually enter SQL command to get the data from the server in JSON format.
